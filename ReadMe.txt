This project's aim is understanding and testing neural networks applications. Project is influenced by "How to Create a Neural Network(and Train it to Iden
tify Doodles). Although it is about neural networks and its applications, this project aims to practice my knowledge of processing different types of inputs,
and outputting visual and live data via StdDraw.
Road Map of Project
-Creating fundamental classes and functions such as Layer, Network.
-Make program keep statics of results. For example accuracy,cost.
-Testing program with  a naural network including 2 input layers, 2 output layers and hidden layers.

This ReadMe text will be updated along the way. So the project will be dynamic and depend on the choices which will be made after the first test.
